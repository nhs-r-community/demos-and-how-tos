# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the demos and how-tos repository.

The NHS-R Community welcomes contributions in the form of:

- Bug fixes and improvements to existing demos and how-tos
- New demos and how-tos

Full training sessions are out of scope for this repository, and should be contained in separate repositories (e.g. the [one-day Shiny training](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/shiny-training)).

## Contributing workflow

If you're new to Github and/or Markdown, [Github's own contributor's guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides a good overview of these topics.

To contribute:

- Review the [issue](#using-issues) list, raise an issue if required
- Fork this repository
- Make changes or add new scripts
- Commit and push to your own repository
- Create a new [pull request](#pull-requests-and-merging) detailing your additions
- Wait for pull request to be reviewed, and merged (not everyone will have permission to merge pull requests)
- Celebrate your first step into the open source world and contribute more

## Using issues

If you spot something that needs to be changed, or would like to suggest some new content, please raise an issue to alert the community.

Before raising a new issue, have a look through the existing ones in case it's already been raised.

## Pull requests and merging

If you have a change (or a new page) to raise, please create an issue first. This alerts the community, as there may be someone thinking of contributing something similar.

You can't push to the main branch. For all changes you will need to create a fork, and then a pull request (click compare across forks and select your version).

Please [reference the issue the pull request resolves](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue), so it will be closed automatically.

## Contributing guidelines and etiquette

- Preview your Markdown code to make sure the format is not broken.
- Material, including commit messages, should be written in clear and simple English.
- Check grammar, spelling and punctuation.
- Nothing included should be confidential, private or disclose any personal data.
- New directories should be created for each new demo or collection of related how-tos.
- Follow the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times

When contributing any additions, the contributor certifies that they are the author, or has cited the author and is authorised to reuse/reference the material
